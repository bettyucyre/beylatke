# How to Get Unbanned on BattleEye (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned by BattleEye can feel like having the gaming cops show up at your door—super annoying, especially if you think it’s a total mix-up. This straightforward guide will walk you through what to do if BattleEye locks you out and how to appeal your ban like a pro to get back into the action.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban hit you the moment you logged in with a fresh account, or does it follow you across multiple accounts? You’re probably **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! BattleEye flags your PC hardware specifically, so even your shiny new accounts get caught in the crossfire.
