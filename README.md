<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban hit you the moment you logged in with a fresh account, or does it follow you across multiple accounts? You’re probably <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! BattleEye flags your PC hardware specifically, so even your shiny new accounts get caught in the crossfire.</p>
